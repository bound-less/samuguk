## Introduction

The SHIWOL Village Event Simulation System is a comprehensive tool designed to help event planners optimize and analyze various aspects of the SHIWOL Village Event. By leveraging advanced algorithms and simulation techniques, this system provides insights into attendance projections, resource allocation, queueing management, and probabilistic outcomes.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run your first simulation:

1. **Installation**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/shiwol-simulation.git
   cd shiwol-simulation
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configuration**
   - Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
   - Edit `config.js` to set your default parameters

3. **Running a Basic Simulation**
   ```javascript
   import SimulationAPI from './src/api/SimulationAPI';

   const api = new SimulationAPI();
   const results = await api.runSimulationWithDefaults();
   console.log(results);
   ```

4. **Viewing Results**
   - Results will be logged to the console
   - For a more detailed report, use `api.generateReport(results)`

## Usage Examples

### Basic Simulation Run

```javascript
const api = new SimulationAPI();
const results = await api.runSimulationWithDefaults();
console.log(results);
```

### Custom Scenario Creation and Comparison

```javascript
const api = new SimulationAPI();

// Create baseline scenario
api.createScenario('Baseline', api.setDefaultParams(), api.setDefaultUserInputs());

// Create high attendance scenario
const highAttendanceParams = {
  ...api.setDefaultParams(),
  dailyAttendanceMax: 3000,
  dailyAttendanceMin: 2000
};
api.createScenario('High Attendance', highAttendanceParams, api.setDefaultUserInputs());

// Compare scenarios
const comparisonResults = await api.compareScenarios(['Baseline', 'High Attendance']);
console.log(comparisonResults);
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

```javascript
const api = new SimulationAPI();

const sensitivityResults = await api.performSensitivityAnalysis(
  api.setDefaultParams(),
  api.setDefaultUserInputs(),
  'ticketPrice',
  0.2,  // 20% variation
  10    // 10 steps
);

console.log(sensitivityResults);
```

### Optimization

```javascript
const api = new SimulationAPI();

const optimizationResults = await api.optimizeTicketPrice(
  api.setDefaultParams(),
  api.setDefaultUserInputs(),
  { min: 15000, max: 25000, step: 1000 }
);

console.log(optimizationResults);
```

## Interpreting Simulation Results

When analyzing your simulation results, consider the following key metrics:

1. **Expected Revenue**: This is the average revenue across all Monte Carlo simulations. It represents the most likely revenue outcome for your event.

2. **Revenue Range**: Look at the minimum and maximum revenues from the simulations. This gives you an idea of the best and worst-case scenarios.

3. **Optimal Resource Allocation**: The Linear Programming results will suggest the best way to allocate your resources (e.g., number of tickets to sell, amount of merchandise to stock).

4. **Queue Times**: Pay attention to the average and maximum queue times from the Queueing Model. Long queues can negatively impact customer satisfaction.

5. **Probabilistic Insights**: The Bayesian Network results show the likelihood of different outcomes based on various factors. Use these to understand the relationships between different aspects of your event.

6. **Sensitivity Analysis**: This shows how changes in one parameter (e.g., ticket price) affect the overall results. Use this to identify which factors have the biggest impact on your event's success.

Remember, these results are based on the input parameters and assumptions of the model. Always combine these insights with your own expertise and knowledge of the specific context of your event.

## Best Practices and Tips

1. **Start with Defaults**: Begin by running a simulation with default parameters. This gives you a baseline to compare against as you refine your inputs.

2. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure that your input parameters are as accurate as possible. The quality of your simulation results depends on the quality of your inputs.

3. **Run Multiple Scenarios**: Create and compare multiple scenarios to understand how different conditions might affect your event.

4. **Use Sensitivity Analysis**: Regularly perform sensitivity analysis to understand which factors have the biggest impact on your event's outcomes.

5. **Iterate and Refine**: Use the insights from each simulation to refine your parameters and run new simulations. This iterative process helps you converge on the best plan for your event.

6. **Combine with Expert Knowledge**: While the simulation provides valuable insights, always combine these with your own expertise and knowledge of the specific context of your event.

7. **Regular Updates**: As you gather real data from your events, use this to calibrate and improve your simulation models.

8. **Document Assumptions**: Keep a clear record of the assumptions that went into each simulation. This helps with interpreting results and refining your approach over time.

9. **Use Visualizations**: Whenever possible, use charts and graphs to visualize your results. This can help in identifying trends and patterns more easily.

10. **Plan for Uncertainty**: Remember that simulations provide estimates. Always include some buffer in your plans to account for the inherent uncertainty in predicting event outcomes.
